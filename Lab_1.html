    <p>
      Hello. My name is Ryan Clemens. I am a current student at MSU Denver. I am a student of Environmental Science emphasizing in Ecological Resoration. I am also on target to obtain my certification is Geographic Information Systems. My graduation date is set for Spring 2022. I am a Colorado native and I value nature very much. A goal of mine, after I graduate, would be to study hawks and help them thrive. After high school, I attended Colorado State University studying Fisheries Biology. Due to some unforseen events, I transfered down to MSU Denver where I am currently finishing my degree.
